## 🎓 **Context**

This project is one of the very first steps of the **[42 Paris](https://42.fr/)** curriculum.  
Its goal is to **reimplement essential C standard library functions** (`strlen`, `memcpy`, `strchr`, etc.) as well as a extra utilities, in order to build a **personal base library**: **libft**.

This library will be **reused in upcoming 42 projects** (like `ft_printf`, `minishell`, `push_swap`, etc.) and serves as the foundation for all future C exercises.

## ⚙️ **Objective**

- Recreate basic string, memory, and character manipulation functions.  
- Implement additional utility functions (`ft_split`, `ft_strjoin`, `ft_itoa`, etc.).  
- Add linked list management functions (`ft_lst*`) for the **bonus part**.  
- Add personal utility functions (`buff_*`, `square_root_*`, etc.).
- Provide a reliable, optimized, and memory-leak-free static library.
